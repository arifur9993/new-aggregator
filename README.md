## Project Information

- This project provides APIs for parsing news from various RSS feeds.
- The application constructs RSS URLs, fetches news articles, and parses them for processing.
- For topic extraction and named entity recognition, the application utilizes OpenAIâ€™s API to extract topics and names from the news content.
- The filtered news API offers a paginated list of all news articles. If no parameters are provided, it defaults to returning all articles. Users can filter news articles by providing `searchText` and `publicationDate` as URL parameters.



## Testing
